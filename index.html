                        <h3>Dukkha</h3>
                        <p class="pali">The Truth of Suffering</p>
                        <p>Life involves suffering, dissatisfaction, and unease. Not just obvious pain, but a subtle undercurrent of incompleteness that runs through even pleasant experiences.</p>

                            <p>The word <em>dukkha</em> is often translated as "suffering," but it's more nuanced. It includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Obvious suffering</strong> - pain, illness, loss, grief</li>
                                <li><strong>Suffering of change</strong> - even pleasure fades, happiness doesn't last</li>
                                <li><strong>Pervasive unsatisfactoriness</strong> - a subtle sense that something is missing, that this moment isn't quite enough</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This isn't pessimism. It's an honest diagnosis. You can't treat what you won't acknowledge.</p>

                        <h3>Samudaya</h3>
                        <p class="pali">The Truth of the Cause</p>
                        <p>Suffering has a cause: craving and attachment. We grasp at pleasure, push away pain, and cling to how we think things should be.</p>
                        <button class="expand-btn" aria-expanded="false">Go Deeper</button>

                            <p>The Pali word is <em>tanha</em> - literally "thirst." Three types:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Craving for pleasure</strong> - wanting pleasant experiences to continue</li>
                                <li><strong>Craving for existence</strong> - wanting to be someone, to matter, to continue</li>
                                <li><strong>Craving for non-existence</strong> - wanting to escape, to not feel, to disappear</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Notice: it's not desire itself that's the problem. It's the <em>clinging</em> - the belief that getting what you want will complete you.</p>

                        <p class="pali">The Truth of Cessation</p>
                        <p>Suffering can end. When craving ceases, suffering ceases. Liberation is possible - not after death, but here, in this life.</p>
                        <button class="expand-btn" aria-expanded="false">Go Deeper</button>

                            <p>This is the good news. The Buddha didn't just diagnose the problem - he confirmed there's a cure.</p>
                            <p><em>Nirvana</em> (Pali: <em>nibbana</em>) literally means "blowing out" - like extinguishing a flame. Not annihilation, but the end of the burning.</p>
                            <p>What ends:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The compulsive craving that drives suffering</li>
                                <li>The illusion of a fixed, separate self that needs defending</li>
                                <li>The cycle of reactivity - wanting, getting, wanting more</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>What remains: peace, clarity, compassion, freedom.</p>

                            <p>The path isn't linear - it's eight aspects of practice that support each other:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Right View, Right Intention</li>
